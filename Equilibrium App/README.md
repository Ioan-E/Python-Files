## Equilibirum app

### Description

The app registers the actual and the desired outcome for 5 life domains. Compares them and provides the results. It uses user input to assess both the actual and the desired outcome. Operator overloading is used to compare the two.

application.py provides the logic, playgorund.py are several use cases, requirements provides detailed tasks that should be completed by this project and test provides several unittests. An interesting case study for operator overloading is here.
Provides an interesting use case for operator overloading.

Because a lot of code is simillar at some point I will try to implement all the classes in a similary way as descriptors are being implemented in Python.

### How to run and use the project

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Open playground.py and change the user object. Call check_status() and see the result.
