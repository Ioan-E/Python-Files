## Roulettte Game

### Description

Roulette simulator. Several players can enter a game based on the credits they have. They bet a certain amount of credits and a random function generates the roulette's outcome. The program is checking the results, awards the prizes and updates the number of players at the table.

This is a project I particularly enjoyed as I had to figure out the logical steps needed to build the game. I created a function for each step and called these functions inside the main game function. For me, this was the first non-trivial project where a class was not the main component. It was a good opportunity to practice algorithmic thinking and use the functionalities provided by Python.

In application.py all the functions used are available. In playground.py the game can be played under a context manager.

### How to run and use the project
